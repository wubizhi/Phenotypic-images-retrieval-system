# Phenotypic-images-retrieval-system
## About
The BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm has been widely used for searching sequence similarities to study the genotype of a query sequence. Although the accumulation of the genotype-phenotype-mapping data, the retrieval system of searching similar phenotypes is not available due to the complex of images processing. Here, we propose a biological Phenotype Retrieval System using deep convolutional encoder-decoder architecture to better understand the genotypes phenotype correlation using deep convolutional encoder-decoder architecture. Taken together, this phenotype retrieval system can provide further information about the correlation between genotype and phenotype
